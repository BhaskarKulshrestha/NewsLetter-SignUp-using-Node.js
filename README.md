# Notes On API's

API = application programming interfaces

api is a set of commands , functions, protocolsand objects that programmers can use to create sofeare or interact with an external system.

## API includes :
###  Endpoints:<br>
    Every API that interacts with the external system will have an endpoint.
### paths:<br>
    A Path is a unit of a REST API that you can call. 
    https://www.ibm.com/docs
    here :
        https://www.ibm.com/ -> home directory
        docs -> specific path 
### parameters:<br>
    API Parameters are options that can be passed with the endpoint to influence the response

    https://www.ibm.com/docs?contains=debugging&rate=5

    parameters are followed by a '?' mark and they are set  as a key value pair (?key=pair) , and we can add more than one parameter by applying '&'
    here:
    contains=debugging and rate=5 is a parameter

### Authentication:<br>
    The API authentication process validates the identity of the client attempting to make a connection by using an authentication protocol. The protocol sends the credentials from the remote client requesting the connection to the remote access server in either plain text or encrypted form.

''' so here we use oen weather API '''
```
for exmaple:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=5ea33718b9315b2e1c359abdeee449aa 
```

## PostMan
    Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster.

### <strong> What is Postman used for? </strong>

Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.

### <u> __JSON__  </u> : javascript object notation
    a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa)

### HTTPS usage :

HTTPS is the HTTP protocol over TLS/SSL. In Node.js this is implemented as a separate module.It is by default in build with the Node.js module during Import.


__https.get(url[, options][, callback])__
```
   - url "<string> | <URL>"
   - options <Object> | <string> | <URL> Accepts the same     options as https.request(), with the method always set to GET.
   - callback <Function>

```
    options can be an object, a string, or a URL object. If options is a string, it is automatically parsed with new URL(). If it is a URL object, it will be automatically converted to an ordinary options object.

    const https = require('node:https');

    https.get('https://encrypted.google.com/', (res) => {
    console.log('statusCode:', res.statusCode);
    console.log('headers:', res.headers);

    res.on('data', (d) => {
        process.stdout.write(d);
    });

    }).on('error', (e) => {
        console.error(e);
    });
------------------------------------------------------
_simulation of a program_

```.js
Line
1    const express = require("express");
2    const https = require("https");
3    
4    // https module is aready bundled with the  node module.
5
6    const app = express()
7
8    app.get("/",function(req,res){
9
10       // inside get we have to give https:// -> it is neccessary.
11
12    const url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Amethi&appid=5ea33718b9315b2e1c359abdeee449aa&units=metric";
13
14        https.get(url,function(response){
15        console.log(response);
16    });
17    res.send("Server is up and running.")
18 })
19
20 app.listen(3000,function(){
21    console.log("Server is listening on port 3000.")
22 })
```
- in line 1&2 we require to modules that is "express" used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily <br> 
and second is "https" that is the HTTPS module provides a way of making Node. js transfer data over HTTP TLS/SSL protocol, which is the secure HTTP protocol. 

- In line 8 we handling the request that is generated by the browser . 

- In line 12 we are providing a url that is the API .

- In line 14 we are handling the request that is generated by the API and generating a resposnse that is stored in the variable "response"

- In linr 17 the response is gerated for the request that is generated by the Line 8.

- Line 20 to 22 handles the localhost at the specified accesspoint or address and genrating the appropriate responsse

--------------------------------------------

### HTTP RESPONSE STATUS CODE

    HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

    Informational responses (100 – 199)
    Successful responses (200 – 299)
    Redirection messages (300 – 399)
    Client error responses (400 – 499)
    Server error responses (500 – 599)

_FOR MORE INFORMATION GOT TO_: [https status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

-------------------------------
```
    response.on("data",function(data){
        console.log(data); // this will generate a hexadecimal result
        //to convert the result for hx to JSON or javascript object use JSON.parse(parameter)
    })

    The on() method requires name of the event to handle and callback function which is called when an event is raised
    here the on method works on "data".
```
### JSON.parse()
    The JSON.parse() static method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string. An optional reviver function can be provided to perform a transformation on the resulting object before it is returned.

```.JS
const json = '{"result":true, "count":42}';
const obj = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj);
// Object { result: true, count: 42 }

console.log(obj.count);
// Expected output: 42

console.log(obj.result);
// Expected output: true

```

JSON.stringify(data)

    converts the javascript object to string.

### NOTE -> we can have only one send function in the app.get() method , if we apply more than one send function then the apllication will crash. But we can have more then one res.write() methods and then apply res.send()

    :) SEND IS JUST LIKE THE END OF A PARTICULAR APPLICATION.
"/"  is used to denote the root directory or home directory.

## <strong>Body Parser</strong>
    Body-parser is a middleware for handling request bodies in Node.js. It is used to parse the incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

    The body-parser module provides various ways to handle request data, including JSON, raw, text and URL-encoded formats.

    Here are some common use cases for body-parser:

    Parsing JSON data: This is the most common use case for body-parser. When you send a JSON request to a server, you can use the body-parser middleware to parse the JSON data from the request body.

    Parsing URL-encoded data: If you are sending data in URL-encoded format (for example, in a HTML form), you can use the body-parser middleware to parse the URL-encoded data from the request body.

    Parsing raw data: If you are sending raw data in the request body, you can use the body-parser middleware to parse the raw data from the request body.

    It's important to note that the body-parser middleware is not included in the Express framework by default, so you'll need to install it separately. Additionally, you'll need to include it in your Express application and configure it to parse the type of data you want to handle

to install Body Parser

    $ npm install body-parser

Use it as :

    var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

<h3>What is the meaning of "bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))" in Express.js?</h3>

    Returns middleware that only parses urlencoded bodies and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts only UTF-8 encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

    A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body). This object will contain key-value pairs, where the value can be a string or array (when extended is false), or any type (when extended is true).


## app.use(express.static("public")) : 

    TRansfer all the static images in the folder named as public. 

    use(express. static()) adds a middleware for serving static files to your Express app. You can use the express. static middleware to make it possible to access files from this folder via HTTP.

    To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express. The function signature is: express. static(root, [options]) The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.

    Basically the images we store into our system is static and server can't process it ,  so to work with static images we use this "static function".

## what is app.post()

    The app. post() function routes the HTTP POST requests to the specified path with the specified callback functions.

## In mail chimp

- To get a API

    https://us21.admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/

- For documentation 

    https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-activity/

- For getting Audience ID / List ID

    https://us21.admin.mailchimp.com/lists/settings/defaults?id=7245



```
    app.post("/failure",function(req,res){
    res.redirect("/"); 
    })

```
    it redirects the user to home route / home directory whenever the user encounters a failure.
